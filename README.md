# Updates in v1.1
Added better fiction support.

#To-Do
Add better ui.
Add preferences.
Add processing for publisher and language.
Remove interference with other extensions.
Port to Chrome (this may not happen for a while due to a large number of incompatibilities but it is on my to-do list)

Thanks for all the support !
